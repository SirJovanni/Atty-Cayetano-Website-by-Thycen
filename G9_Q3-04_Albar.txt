<h1>My Personal Commentary about Cayetano's Excellence</h1>
<hr>
<p>I didn't know someone who was born here in Orion, Bataan would become the first Chief Justice of the Philippines and not just that,
he also became the longest serving Chief Justice of the Philippines for serving almost 2 decades before his retirement but even if that is 100 years ago
it is still impressive for me that since his retirement none of the other Chief Justices who took his place had served that long until today.
Happy birthday to our longest serving Chief Justice of the Philippines, March 2, 2023 </p>
